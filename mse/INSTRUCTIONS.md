# Mood Swings card template for Magic Set Editor 2 (Edition 1 frames)

This zip has everything needed to type card data into [Magic Set Editor 2](https://github.com/twanvl/MagicSetEditor2) (MSE) and export finished Mood Swings cards (744 x 1040 pixels, 300 dpi).

## What is in the zip

| Item | What it is |
|---|---|
| `mood-swings.mse-game/` | The game: the fields of a card. |
| `mood-swings-edition1.mse-style/` | The stylesheet: where each field goes on the card, plus the frame images. |
| `mood-swings-dice.mse-symbol-font/` | A symbol font for the dice used inside rules text (0 to 6). |
| `examples/edition1-sample.mse-set/` | A small sample set (Pacifism, Fear, Determination, a two-dice card and FOMO). |
| `examples/emotional-baggage.mse-set/` | The whole custom set, Emotional Baggage (code XEMB): the 133 slotted cards of the community design (backup candidates are left out until they are chosen for play testing). Only the 11 reprints (Pacifism, Panic, Fear, Hate, Suspicion, Shock, Zeal, Compulsion, Joy, Nostalgia, Determination) have their original art and artist, and Admiration, Adrenaline, Affinity, Anticipation and Ardor have their new art (by Joseph Eddy); the other new cards have none yet. The collector numbers are provisional and start with an X (X001 to X133, by color in the order colorless, white, blue, black, red, green, then alphabetically by name) to mark them as unofficial. |

## 1. Install

1. Unzip this file.
2. Copy the three folders ending in `.mse-game`, `.mse-style` and `.mse-symbol-font` into MSE's `data` folder:
   - Windows: `C:\Program Files\Magic Set Editor 2\data`, or `%APPDATA%\Magic Set Editor\data` if you cannot write to Program Files.
   - Keep each folder as it is; do not put them inside another folder.
3. Install the fonts below. They are not included, so you have to get them yourself:
   - **Beleren Small Caps Bold**: card name and artist name
   - **MPlantin** and **MPlantin-Italic**: rules text and the "designed by" line (the italic font is used for reminder text; bold uses MPlantin's bold)
   - **Gotham**: collector number and set code
4. Start MSE. Choose **File > Open** and open `examples/edition1-sample.mse-set`, or choose **File > New** and pick **Mood Swings**.

## 2. Fill in a card

Click a card in the list, then edit its fields in the panel next to the card. Click the card picture to edit the text on the card itself.

| Field | What it does |
|---|---|
| name | Card name. It shrinks if it is long. |
| frame color | White, blue, black, red, green or colorless (a dark slate frame with its own mix of shapes, art tilt and grid). |
| top die | The value at the top right. 0 shows a numeral, 1 to 6 show pips on one die, and **7 to 12 show two dice** (a 6 plus the rest); two dice push the name and the "!" icon to the left. |
| top die color | White or black. Use **black** when the card's own value is set or changed by a "While in play — This mood's value ..." ability (for example Determination, "value is 6 if ...", or Euphoria, "increases by 1 for each ..."), and **white** for a value that changes after playing, for growth through a trigger ("at the start of each of your turns ... increases") and for ordinary cards. |
| reminder icon | Ticks on the "!" icon next to the top die. |
| lower die | The alternate value at the lower left: 1 to 6 is one die, 7 to 12 is two dice, or none. The rules text flows around the dice. |
| lower die color | White or black. Use the same color as the top die. |
| rarity | Common, uncommon, rare or mythic. |
| rules text | Centered. Use bold for the ability timing ("After playing this mood") and italic for reminder text. A few words are also printed in bold for emphasis, for example "any" in Hate and "next" in Joy. To put a die inside the text, use the **Insert Symbol** menu and pick a die (0 to 6; for 7 to 12 use two dice, a 6 and the rest). The printed cards write every number in the rules text as a die, including values such as "a value of 3 or less" and "increases by 2". |
| designed by | Optional. A small italic line at the bottom of the rules text box. Type the whole line, for example `Designed by Jane Doe`. Leave it empty for none. |
| art | Click the art box and choose an image. It is clipped to the slanted frame. The art box is **585 x 452** for every color, so make art at that size. A few pixels at the corners are cut off by the opening on the more tilted frames (red and green most). |
| set symbol | The symbol on the tab at the lower right. Empty shows the default symbol, a cracked heart behind a padlock (the Emotional Baggage set symbol). To use your own, click the box and choose an image: use a **square** image (it is drawn into an 80 x 80 box and stretched to fit), ideally white on a transparent background so it shows on every frame color. |
| set code | The code at the bottom left (default `XEMB`, the working set code of the custom set Emotional Baggage; change it in Set Info). Set it once in **Set > Set Info** and every card follows it; type something on a card to override it. |
| collector number | Bottom left, for example `0020`. |
| artist | Bottom left, after the brush icon. |

Not editable (part of the frame images): the color word, the brush icon and the copyright line.

## 3. Export

- **File > Export > Images...** writes every card as an image file.
- **File > Export > HTML...** and **File > Print** are also available. Printing and bleed are not set up in this template.
- The card size is 744 x 1040 pixels (a multiple of 4, as some game clients need).

## Tuning

If something is a few pixels off, the numbers are in `mood-swings-edition1.mse-style/style` (a text file; indent with TAB characters only):

- Positions and sizes of the name, set code, collector number, artist, "designed by" and rules text boxes (`left`, `top`, `width`, `height`, `font: size`).
- The size of dice inside the rules text: `size` in the `symbol font` block of `rules text` (default 28).
- If your version of MSE does not accept images in a subfolder, move the files out of `img/` and remove the `img/` prefix in the style file.
